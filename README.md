# Using typed-rpc in a Fresh project

[![Made with Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/fresh-badge.svg)](https://fresh.deno.dev)

The API is defined in `/service.ts` and exposed in `/routes/api.ts`. Finally,
`/islands/Hello.tsx` calls the API and prints the result.

## Usage

Start the project:

```
deno task start
```

Refer to the [typed-rpc](https://github.com/fgnass/typed-rpc) README for further
details.
